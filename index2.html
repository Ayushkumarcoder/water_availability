    <p class="welP text-left mb-2 resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">The surface-water resources of a nation are the water in the rivers, streams, creeks, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs which is vitally important to our everyday life. It is an important source of drinking water and is used for the irrigation, industrial and as well as other public uses. The availability of surface water varies depending upon the precipitation, storage capacity (lakes, wetlands and artificial reservoirs), permeability of the soil, runoff characteristics of the land, timing of precipitation and the local evaporation rates etc.</p>

    <p class="welP text-left mb-2 resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">Information of surface water and availability in a single platform is a prerequisite for resources planning. India-WRIS web portal collects data regarding surface water from varied sources, stores and manages the data and also make it available to download in a report format for easy access to users. This information is also used for derived information in Water Audit module</p>

    <p class="welP text-left mb-2 resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">The modules containing surface water data are:</p>

    <ul class="orange_arrow pd-0">
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Reservoir level:</b> The information of the amount of water (Average Current Storage in BCM) stored in reservoirs across the country, based on data from different sources.&nbsp;</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Reservoir Sediment Study:</b> This module provides information of capacity loss of reservoirs due to silt deposition. It offers the result of sediment study done using remote sensing technique and hydrographic survey of some selected reservoirs spread across the country. Data of the catchment area of the reservoir, design rate of sedimentation, initial capacity &amp; reservoir levels in different years etc. of those selected reservoirs are provided in this module.</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Surface Water Bodies:&nbsp;</b>It offers the visualization of mapped water bodies with associated information categorized under different area classes at administrative (National/State/District) and hydrological unit-wise (Basin/ Sub-basin).</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Rivers points (hydro-observation stations) data:&nbsp;</b>Information of the hydro-observations sites live daily water level and river flow time series data is available in this module.</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>River Information:&nbsp;</b>The module shows river systems of the country with its associated attributes such as river name, length, origin, order, etc.</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Snow Glacial Lakes:&nbsp;</b>It contains information of glacial lakes and water bodies of Himalayan regions for the years 2011 to 2021 covering the major river basins namely, Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra. The glacial lakes/water bodies have been mapped based on the visual interpretation of AWiFS satellite images. The water-spread areas of glacial lakes and water-bodies (&gt;50 hectares) from 2011 to 2021 (June to October) and the change in the WSA (base year 2009) is presented as per the joint study of CWC &amp; NRSC.</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Wetlands:&nbsp;</b>It provides the spatial extent &amp; comparison of wetland and its sub categories for pre-monsoon and post-monsoon for two cycles of assessment (1994 and 2005).</li>
        <li class="resentFontPanel aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true"><b>Surface water quality:&nbsp;</b>The data of 85 parameters measured for water quality is available on a monthly basis from Aug-1963 to till date.</li>
       </ul>
